# Travel Buddy API

Node.js and TypeScript backend for the Travel Buddy platform.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24 or newer
- npm 11 or newer
- Docker Desktop for local PostgreSQL

## Local setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
docker compose up -d postgres
npm run db:migrate:deploy
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

On Windows PowerShell, copy the environment file with:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

The API runs at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

- API documentation: `http://localhost:3000/docs`
- Health endpoint: `GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health`
- Readiness endpoint: `GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/readiness`
- Browse public trips: `GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/trips`
- Public trip details: `GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/trips/:tripId`

The health endpoint reports whether the Node.js process is running. The
readiness endpoint also checks whether PostgreSQL is reachable.

## Public trips API

`GET /api/v1/trips` supports these optional query parameters:

- `origin`: case-insensitive partial city match
- `destination`: exact community slug, such as `manali`
- `departureFrom` and `departureTo`: `YYYY-MM-DD` date window
- `minBudget` and `maxBudget`: inclusive budget overlap
- `transport`: `BUS`, `TRAIN`, `FLIGHT`, `CAR`, `MOTORCYCLE`, `OTHER`, or
  `UNDECIDED`
- `sort`: `newest` (default) or `departure_asc`
- `page` and `pageSize`: page-based pagination; page size is capped at 100

Only `PUBLISHED` and `FULL` trips in active communities are public. Draft,
paused, cancelled, and completed trips return `404` from the details endpoint so
their existence is not disclosed.

Run `npm run db:seed` to load repeatable local sample data. The seed is safe to
run more than once. Open `/docs` after starting the server to explore the full
request and response schemas.

## Database workflow

The project uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. Prisma keeps database changes in
reviewable migrations instead of changing production tables automatically.

```bash
npm run db:validate
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate:dev -- --name describe_your_change
```

Use `db:migrate:dev` only for local development. Deployed environments apply
committed migrations with:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:deploy
```

Never run development migrations or destructive reset commands against staging
or production databases.

## Quality checks

```bash
npm run format:check
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run test:integration
npm run build
npm run db:validate
```

The integration tests require a reachable PostgreSQL database with all committed
migrations applied. GitHub Actions runs these tests automatically against an
isolated PostgreSQL service for every pull request.

```

## Git workflow

Do not commit directly to `main`. Create a focused branch, run all quality
checks, push the branch, and open a pull request for review.
